# mooStack

**Minecraft 1.21.1 · NeoForge**  
A large, highly-integrated modpack focused on **systems-first progression**, **deep cross-mod unification**, and **long-term playability** rather than isolated features.

mooStack emphasizes **cohesive mechanics**, **shared materials**, and **intentional overlap removal** across magic, technology, farming, combat, and world generation.

---

## Core Design Pillars

- **Integration over accumulation**  
  Mods are not just installed — they are unified, trimmed, and rewired to work together.

- **Machine-first progression**  
  Crafting tables are minimized. Processing, automation, and infrastructure matter.

- **Single-source materials**  
  Duplicate ores, ingots, fluids, plates, foods, and tools are consolidated into canonical versions.

- **Long-form gameplay**  
  Systems scale with time: food variety, combat difficulty, loot tiers, tech depth, and exploration all evolve.

## Major Gameplay Systems

### Combat & Difficulty

- **Epic Fight** – Animation-based combat with weapon categories and battle modes.
- **Undead Nights + Enhanced Celestials** – Blood Moon–driven horde nights with tiered difficulty scaling.
- **Apotheosis** – Loot rarity, bosses, and affix system.
- **Silent Gear (expanded)** – Modular weapons and armor used everywhere, including Apotheosis loot.
- **Epic Knights + Samurai Dynasty** – Medieval and samurai armor sets, fully integrated with Epic Fight.

**Key integrations**

### Technology & Automation

- **Mekanism** – Core processing, chemistry, power, and factories.

- **Applied Energistics 2** – Digital storage and autocrafting.
- **PneumaticCraft, Industrial Foregoing, RFTools** – Specialized automation layers.

**Immersive Engineering Extensions**

- **Extensive juice squeezing potion system**:
  - Crops, fruits, and plants can be processed through IE machinery into drinkable juices
  - Juices function as long-duration consumable potions rather than instant effects
  - Multiple juice effects can be active simultaneously with controlled stacking limits
  - Effect strength and duration scale by ingredient type and processing tier
  - Integrated fully into IE fluid handling, bottling, and automation chains

**Key integrations**

- Unified fluids (plant oil, biodiesel, juices) across IE, Mekanism, PneumaticCraft, and Create.
- IE machines used for weapons, coins, food oils, advanced chemistry, and consumables.
- AE2 extended with Mekanism chemicals, Create kinetics, and large-scale cells.

- **Croptopia** (heavily trimmed and reworked).
- **Spice of Life: Ascension** – Food complexity and dietary diversity progression.
- **Mystical Agriculture, Productive Bees** – Resource farming at scale.

**Key integrations**

- Food moved from crafting tables to machines (ovens, cook pots, chillers).
- Duplicate foods removed in favor of single authoritative sources.
- Food quality and variety directly affect hunger, saturation, and buffs.

### Space & Chemistry (Custom Systems)

- **ChemLib Mekanized** – Periodic table elements rebuilt using Mekanism chemistry.
- **Ad Astra Mekanized** – Space exploration powered by Mekanism energy, oxygen, and IE fuels.

**Key integrations**

## Summary

mooStack is not a kitchen-sink pack.  
It is a **systems-driven Minecraft platform** where:

- Mods reinforce each other instead of overlapping
- Progression is earned through infrastructure
- Materials and mechanics remain consistent across hundreds of features
- Complexity increases over time, not all at once

If you enjoy **deep integration**, **meaningful progression**, and **long-term worlds**, this pack is built for you.
