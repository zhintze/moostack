## mooStack-Specific Content

### Integration with Silent Gear
- Starting quest requires crafting a **Silent Gear fishing rod** (not Aquaculture rods)
- Fish processing uses **Silent Gear knife** or Farmer's Delight knife
- Neptunium described as usable as a **Silent Gear material**

### Integration with Farmer's Delight
- Fish fillet processing uses the **Farmer's Delight cutting board**
- Modified from vanilla Aquaculture fillet knife mechanics

### Hooks Focus
Instead of covering Aquaculture's tiered fishing rods (Iron/Gold/Diamond/Neptunium), the chapter focuses on the 9 hook types:
1. Iron Hook - 20% durability protection
2. Gold Hook - +1 Luck
3. Diamond Hook - 50% durability protection
4. Light Hook - Further casts, faster retrieval
5. Heavy Hook - Faster sinking, deeper fishing
6. Double Hook - 10% chance for double catch
7. Redstone Hook - Extended catch window
8. Note Hook - Audible fish alert
9. Nether Star Hook - 50% durability + 1 Luck

## ID Allocation

### Chapter ID
- `492649F619082A45` (regenerated by FTB Quests)

### Quest ID Structure
Uses structured hex IDs with `AC` prefix for Aquaculture-unique identification:
- Section 1: `AC01000000000001` - `AC01000000000002`
- Section 2: `AC02000000000001` - `AC02000000000003`
- Section 3: `AC03000000000001` - `AC03000000000009`
- Section 4: `AC04000000000001` - `AC04000000000004`
- Section 5: `AC05000000000001` - `AC05000000000003`
- Section 6: `AC06000000000001` - `AC06000000000004`
- Section 7: `AC07000000000001` - `AC07000000000003`
- Section 8: `AC08000000000001` - `AC08000000000002`
- Section 9: `AC09000000000001` - `AC09000000000032`

### Task/Reward ID Pattern
- Task IDs: `ACSS0000000000TT` (S = section, T = task number within quest)
- Reward IDs: `ACSS0000000000RR` (S = section, R = reward number within quest)

### Why AC Prefix?
The `AC` prefix (valid hex: A=10, C=12) ensures Aquaculture IDs don't conflict with other chapters that use numeric-only prefixes like `0001`, `0002`, etc.
